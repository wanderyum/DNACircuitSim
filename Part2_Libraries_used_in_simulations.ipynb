For more details, you can refer to the official docs: [numpy & scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)\n",

    "### 2.1 Modules\n",
    "Python module is the highest-level program organization unit, which packages program code and data for reuse, and provides self-contained namespaces that minimize variable name clashes across your programs. In concrete terms, modules typically correspond to Python program files. Each file is a module, and modules import other modules to use the names they define. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python modules are easy to create; they're just files of Python program code created with a text editor. You don't need to write special syntax to tell Python you're making a module; almost any text file will do. Because Python handles all the details of finding and loading modules, modules are also easy to use; clients simply import a module, or specific names a module defines, and use the objects they reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Module Creation\n",
    "To define a module, simply use your text editor to type some Python code into a text file, and save it with a “.py” extension; any such file is automatically considered a Python module. All the names assigned at the top level of the module become its attributes (names associated with the module object) and are exported for clients to use—they morph from variable to module object attribute automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you type the following def into a file called module1.py and import it, you create a module object with one attribute—the name printer , which happens to be a reference to a function object:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def printer(x):        # Module attribute\n",
    "    print(x)\n",

    "#### 2.1.2 Module Usage\n",
    "Clients can use the simple module file we just wrote by running an **import** or **from** statement. Both statements find, compile, and run a module file's code, if it hasn't yet been loaded. The chief difference is that **import** fetches the module as a whole, so you must qualify to fetch its names; in contrast, **from** fetches (or copies) specific names out of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what this means in terms of code. All of the following examples wind up calling the printer function defined in the prior section's module1.py module file, but in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The import Statement\n",

    "\n",
    "##### The from Statement\n",
